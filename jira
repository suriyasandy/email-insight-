Title:
Deliver Business-Ready Email Extraction and Trade Data Reporting Tool

Type:
Business Requirement / Story

Description:
As part of ongoing compliance, analytics, and operations, we need a robust solution allowing business users to extract, consolidate, and report trade-related data directly from Outlook emails and .msg files with minimal technical effort. The tool must support regulatory reporting, internal audits, productivity improvement, and process transparency for multiple teams.

Business Objectives:
- Eliminate manual copy-paste or risk-prone bulk processing—reduce effort and errors in extracting trade data from email content.
- Enable end-users in operations, compliance, and surveillance to quickly retrieve structured trade info from both their mailboxes and legacy MSG files, regardless of email volume.
- Support multiple trade IDs or patterns per batch to minimize repeated effort.
- Provide central export for reporting, sharing, or further reconciliation with downstream applications.

Key Business Acceptance Criteria:
- User can “point and click” to select Outlook folder or upload files, enter multiple trade IDs, and see all relevant emails and extracted data without technical knowledge.
- Extraction is repeatable and reliable, matching regulatory requirements for completeness, auditability, and minimizing false positives/negatives.
- All extracted results (trade IDs, key deal info, matched tables) can be exported to a single file and handed off to compliance, audit, or analytics teams.
- Solution is easy to deploy and maintain: runs on standard Windows workstations, does not require IT intervention for every user, and can accommodate process/requirement changes.

KPIs/Value:
- Reduce hours spent on manual email retrieval and reporting by 80%+.
- Decrease compliance/audit cycles and exceptions from missed data.
- Increase speed and reliability of business/ops responses to regulatory queries.

Out-of-Scope:
- Integration with non-Outlook email systems and cloud email at this phase.
- Fully automated workflow/batch unattended operation (phase 2).

Notes:
- The solution must be thoroughly user-tested before business rollout.
- Documentation, user guide, and business change support should accompany delivery.
